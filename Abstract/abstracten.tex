\begin{abstract}
\textsl{Wide-angle lenses} are often used in scientific or virtual reality applications to enlarge the field of view of a conventional
camera. Wide-angle lens distortion correction is an \textsl{image
warping application} which transforms the distorted images
back to the natural-looking, \textsl{central perspective space}. This
application is characterized by a non-linear streaming memory access pattern that makes main memory bandwidth a
key performance limiter.\newline

Cell is a heterogeneous multi-core processor that has been architected to accelerate
applications with large degree of thread- and data-level parallelism.\newline

This thesis presents the implementation, optimization and
evaluation of a wide-angle lens distortion correction algorithm on the Cell Broadband Engine. We alleviate the `memory wall' inefficiencies by
applying source level optimizations such as \textsl{tiling} to better
utilize the on-chip memory of the \ac{SPE}, and maximize data
reuse within a frame of pixel data. Using these transformations on the Cell processor, we are able to achieve a \(7.27x\)
speedup compared to a \textsl{Intel Core2 Duo} processor, and enable
potential applications such as real-time correction for video
teleconferencing using cameras with wide-angle lenses.
